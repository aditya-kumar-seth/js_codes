--fetch is a modern built-in JavaScript function that allows you to make HTTP requests (to APIs/servers) without reloading the page.
its similar to XMLHttpRequest but with a simpler and cleaner API.


 Fetch utilizes Promises, which offer a cleaner and more modern way to handle asynchronous operations compared to XHR's callback-based approach. This leads to more readable and maintainable code, especially when dealing with sequential requests or error handling.
---Fetch--- is integrated with modern web features like Service Workers and--- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) ---and is part of the JavaScript ecosystem.

--fetch API is built on promises, so it works well with async/await syntax.

    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')//this returns a promise and means the request is sent
        .then(response => response.json()) // response.json() also returns a promise
        .then(data => {
            console.log('Data received:', data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        });
