In programming:

Client (browser / frontend) asks for some data.

Server (backend / API provider) sends the data back in a structured way (usually JSON).

ðŸ”¹ API Requests in JavaScript

In JS, we usually make API requests to get, send, update, or delete data from a server.
These requests follow HTTP methods:

GET â†’ Retrieve data

POST â†’ Send new data

PUT / PATCH â†’ Update existing data

DELETE â†’ Remove data

ðŸ”¹ What is XMLHttpRequest (XHR)?

XMLHttpRequest is an older built-in JavaScript object that allows you to make HTTP requests (to APIs/servers)
 without reloading the page.//no reloading of the page means no blocking of the main thread means asynchronous operation
 Why "XML" in the name?

Originally, data was often transferred in XML format.

But now, most APIs use JSON instead.

Still, the object is called XMLHttpRequest for historical reasons.

Every XMLHttpRequest goes through a series of states while sending/receiving data. These are tracked by the readyState property.

ðŸ”¹ XMLHttpRequest.readyState Values
Value	State Name	Meaning
0	UNSENT	Created, but open() not called yet
1	OPENED	open() has been called, but request not sent yet
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers + status are available
3	LOADING	Response body is being downloaded (partial data available)
4	DONE	Request completed (success or failure)
