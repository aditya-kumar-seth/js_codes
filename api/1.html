    Every XMLHttpRequest goes through a series of states while sending/receiving data. These are tracked by the readyState property.

ðŸ”¹ XMLHttpRequest.readyState Values
Value	State Name	Meaning
0	UNSENT	Created, but open() not called yet
1	OPENED	open() has been called, but request not sent yet
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers + status are available
3	LOADING	Response body is being downloaded (partial data available)
4	DONE	Request completed (success or failure)
</body>
